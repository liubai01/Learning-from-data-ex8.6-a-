## Introduction

The solution code in Python3 to the exercise 8.6(a) of [learning from data](http://amlbook.com/).

## A brief recall of the question

Construct a toy data set with N = 20 using the method in Example 8.4.
(a) Run the SVM algorithm to obtain the maximum margin separator (b, w) SVM and compute its E_out and margin.

**Note:** If you want more details(like what is Example8.4), please query the book(e-Chapter8) by yourself. Because it may be offensive if I post all the detailed content in the book.

## Prerequisite

[cvxopt](http://cvxopt.org/), [seaborns](http://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Hint

If you have trouble in the code of linear hard-margin SVM classifer, [my another repository](https://github.com/liubai01/hard-margin-SVM-tutorial-by-cvxopt) may provide you enough guidance.
